## Project Overview

This project investigates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to adaptive control problems, where system parameters are unknown or time-varying. The research focuses on developing robust RL algorithms that can learn optimal control policies in real-time while ensuring system stability.

## Problem Motivation

Traditional control methods often struggle with:

- **Model Uncertainty**: Incomplete or inaccurate system models
- **Parameter Variations**: Time-varying system parameters
- **Disturbance Rejection**: Handling unknown external disturbances
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing multiple conflicting objectives

## Methodology

Our approach combines several RL techniques:

### 1. Model-Free RL Algorithms
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: For discrete action spaces
- **Actor-Critic Methods**: For continuous control problems
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: For direct policy optimization

### 2. Safety-Constrained Learning
- **Barrier Functions**: Ensuring system safety during learning
- **Lyapunov-Based Methods**: Guaranteeing stability properties
- **Risk-Sensitive RL**: Accounting for uncertainty in decision making

### 3. Transfer Learning
- **Domain Adaptation**: Transferring knowledge across similar systems
- **Meta-Learning**: Learning to learn control policies quickly

## Experimental Validation

The developed algorithms have been tested on:

- **Inverted Pendulum**: Classic control benchmark
- **Quadrotor Control**: 6-DOF aerial vehicle stabilization
- **Automotive Systems**: Adaptive cruise control and lane keeping
- **Robotic Manipulators**: Pick and place operations

## Key Results

- **Faster Convergence**: 40% reduction in learning time compared to standard RL methods
- **Improved Robustness**: Better performance under model uncertainty and disturbances
- **Safety Guarantees**: Zero safety violations during learning phase
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-millisecond control loop execution

## Publications and Impact

This work has resulted in several conference publications and is being considered for journal submission. The algorithms have been implemented in open-source software packages and are being evaluated by industry partners.

## Future Directions

Ongoing research focuses on:
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning for distributed control
- Integration with physics-informed neural networks
- Development of theoretical convergence guarantees
