Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Fridolin F. Paiki, a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, where I'm pursuing cutting-edge research in machine learning and system identification.

## About Me

With over a decade of experience in software engineering, I've transitioned into the exciting world of AI research, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. My passion lies in developing data-driven solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications.

## Research Focus

Under the guidance of [Prof. Mario Sznaier](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/sznaier-mario/), my research centers on:

- **Machine Learning for Control Systems**: Developing novel deep learning approaches for system identification and control
- **Data-Driven Modeling**: Creating robust models from limited data using transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring RL applications in dynamic system control and optimization

## Background

Before entering academia, I spent 10+ years as a software engineer, gaining valuable experience in full-stack development, data engineering, and system architecture. This industry experience provides me with a unique perspective on translating research into real-world applications.

## Interests

When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me exploring Boston's hiking trails with my camera, reading about the latest developments in AI, or sharing insights on technology through my blog posts.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on research projects or discuss opportunities in machine learning and control systems!
